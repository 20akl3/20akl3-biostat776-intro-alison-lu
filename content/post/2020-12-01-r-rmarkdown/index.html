<h1>Background</h1>
<p>Hello there! My name is Alison Lu and I’m a second year ScM student in the MMI department. I majored in biology and economics in undergrad and worked exclusively with STATA for a number of econ projects. I’m excited to dive into R with this course and hopefully learn some new tools I can apply to my research.</p>

<div id="research" class="section level1">
<h1>Research</h1>
<p>I’m currently working on an expansion microscopy project that aims to produce high resolution images of mitochondrial effects/changes after a viral infection. A number of the image processing programs I run actually use machine and deep learning to help clean everything up.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I’ve won a national championship my sophomore year of college.</li>
<li>The fastest time it’s taken me to solve a rubik’s cube was around 30 seconds.</li>
<li>I can perform three magic tricks fairly well… and two not so well.</li>
<li>Will go to semi-extreme lengths for a good concert. Drove 3 hours to NYC one afternoon and made it back for my 9am the next day :)</li>
<li>I’ve “caught” a home run once at a Red Sox’s game.</li>
</ol>

<p>A hilarious game to watch but quite frustrating to actually play. I tend to move the character backwards much more often than I do forwards.</p>
